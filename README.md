# Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to derive insights from the Superstore's sales data to answer the following key questions:
1. What is the total revenue generated by the store?
2. Which category of products contributes the most to sales?
3. How has the sales trend been for the past year?
4. Which region has the highest sales and which one has the lowest?
5. What is the average profit margin of the store?

## User Story

As the Regional Manager, I want to identify the bestselling products and the recent trends, so that I can decide on which products would be best to run marketing campaigns on to generate a good ROI.

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Transformation
4. Testing
5. Visualization
6. Analysis
7. Recommendations
8. Conclusion


# Design

## Dashboard components required 
What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?

- What is the total revenue generated by the store?
- Which category of products contributes the most to sales?
- How has the sales trend been for the past year?
- Which region has the highest sales and which one has the lowest?

# Development

## Data Exploration Steps

How can we approach the problem to create a solution from start to finish?

  1. Get the data from a reliable data source
  2. Explore the data in Excel to check for any errors that standout
  3. Create addtional columns using to find the distinct orders, return rate, and distinct return rate
  4. Create pivot tables to summarise customers and order data, sales data and product data
  5. Create pivot charts to visualise the data
  6. Create slicers to ease the navigation through the data
  7. Arrange the visualisation dashboards
  8. Generate the findings based on the insights
  9. Write the documentation + commentary
  10. Publish the insights generated


## Data exploration notes

This is the stage where we scan the data for errors, inconcsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc.
