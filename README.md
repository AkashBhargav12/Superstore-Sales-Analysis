# Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to derive insights from the Superstore's sales data to answer the following key questions:
1. What is the total revenue generated by the store?
2. Which category of products contributes the most to sales?
3. How has the sales trend been for the past year?
4. Which region has the highest sales and which one has the lowest?
5. What is the average profit margin of the store?

## User Story

As the General Manager, I want to identify the bestselling products and the recent trends, so that I can decide on which products would be best to run marketing campaigns on to generate a good ROI. 


# Data Source

The data for this analysis is sourced from the Superstore Sales dataset, which includes detailed information on orders, returns, users, and various dashboards and pivot tables. The dataset comprises multiple sheets:
- Description and Questions
- Orders
- Returns
- Users

The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

# Stages

The project is divided into several stages:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Transformation
4. Testing
5. Visualization
6. Analysis
7. Recommendations
8. Conclusion


# Design

## Dashboard components required 
What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?

- What is the total revenue generated by the store?
- Which category of products contributes the most to sales?
- How has the sales trend been for the past year?
- Which region has the highest sales and which one has the lowest?
- What is the average profit margin of the store?

## Mockup

The design phase includes creating mockups to visualize the expected output of the dashboards and reports. Mockups help in understanding the layout and design elements that will be used in the final visualizations.

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Line Chart
2. Bar Chart
3. Scorecards
4. Pie Chart

## Tools Used

This project analysis has been conducted entirely within **Excel** to showcase the depth of knowlege with the toold and the expertise.


# Development

## Data Exploration Steps

How can we approach the problem to create a solution from start to finish?

  1. Get the data from a reliable data source
  2. Explore the data in Excel to check for any errors that standout
  3. Create addtional columns using to find the distinct orders, return rate, and distinct return rate
  4. Create pivot tables to summarise customers and order data, sales data and product data
  5. Create pivot charts to visualise the data
  6. Create slicers to ease the navigation through the data
  7. Arrange the visualisation dashboards
  8. Generate the findings based on the insights
  9. Write the documentation + commentary
  10. Publish the insights generated


## Data exploration notes

This is the stage where we scan the data for errors, inconcsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc. 

The data exploration stage involves understanding the structure of the raw data. The key findings from each sheet in the SuperStoreUS-2015.xlsx file are summarized below:

1. Orders Sheet: Contains detailed order information including sales, profit, product categories, and customer details.
2. Returns Sheet: Lists the orders that were returned.
3. Users Sheet: Provides information on regional managers.

- What are the initial observations with this dataset? What's caught our attention so far?

1. The dataset includes detailed order information with relevant dates, sales and profit figures. The initial exploration reveales that the quality of the data is high and we have everything we need to perform the analysis.
2. The Returns and Users sheets contains data that can be linked to orders through 'Order ID' and 'Region'.
3. There are some blanks and irregular data that needs to be cleaned before conducting the analysis. 
4. There is a need to calculate the dintinct number of orders and returns.


## Data cleaning 
- What do we expect the clean data to look like? What should it contain? What contraints should we apply to it?

The aim is to refine the dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

1. Removing any duplicate entries in the orders IDs
2. Handling any missing values in critical columns like sales and profit

Below is a table outlining the our cleaned dataset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Orders |           |
| Number of Rows | 1953 |
| Number of Columns | 25 |
| --- | --- |
| Returns |           |
| Number of Rows | 1635 |
| Number of Columns | 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Users |           |
| Number of Rows | 5 |
| Number of Columns | 2 |
